{EPITECH} | Second year | Math project

Every Sunday you play Yams (a.k.a. Yahtzee) with your grandmother. 
You have decided to cheat your way to victory by developing a software that will give you the chances to obtain a given combination on the next dice roll.

The different combinations are:
 - a pair (at least 2 dice of the same value),
 - a three-of-a-kind (at least 3 dice of the same value),
 - a four-of-a-kind (at least 4 dice of the same value),
 - a full house (one pair and one three-of-a-kind),
 - a straight (5 dice of sequential value),
 - a yahtzee (5 dice of the same value).

A combination is defined by its kind (pair, three-of-a-kind, four-of-a-kind, full-house, straight or yahtzee) and its value (for a full-house, the value of the three-of-a-kind then the value of the pair, for the straight, the value of the highest die).

See the subject for further details !
